Welcome to the DEMO of the CROPPER algorithm. 

This DEMO can be launched with Jupyter Notebook.
If you do not yet have Jupyter Notebook, please download it.
Please type "jupyter notebook" in the directory of the project once you have cloned it.
Then open the file "CROPPER_DEMO.ipynb".
Select "Cell" and "Run All" and then go to the last bottom cell of the project.
